# Free Medium

## Abstract
This browser extension allows users to access member-only Medium articles for free.

## Important Note 
This browser extension currently does not work while the DuckDuckGo browser extension is being used on Medium. If you have both extensions installed, you'll need to disable DuckDuckGo temporarily and refresh the page in order to read member-only Medium articles using Free Medium. 

## Tech Stack
This project uses vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. 

## Setup/Installation
You can clone the repo locally using `git clone`. 

[This article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) offers detailed instructions on loading an unpacked chrome extension. You can navigate to the chrome extensions page via the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar. After enabling developer mode, you can click "load unpacked extension" and choose the folder via the popup. You should then see the book icon appear in the toolbar. When you click on it, you can see "Free Medium." If you navigate to `www.medium.com` and view more than 3 articles without being logged in, you should still be able to access each article without hitting a paywall. 

## Preview



## Next Steps
I'd like to hide the gray bar that indicates how many member-only articles you have left.
